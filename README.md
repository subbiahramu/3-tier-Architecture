3-tier-Architecture

High Availability: Ensure your architecture is highly available, capable of withstanding failures, and can provide uninterrupted service.

Scalability: Design your architecture to be highly scalable, allowing for easy and efficient resource scaling as your application's demands increase.

Fault Tolerance: Implement fault-tolerant mechanisms to minimize downtime and service interruptions during failures.

Custom VPC/VNET: Consider using a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for AWS , or a similar network customization instead of relying on the default configurations.

Security: Prioritize security by adhering to best practices for Identity and Access Management (IAM) and implementing robust security measures.
